The project focuses on reviewing machine learning in fluid mechanics. Firstly, review some of the relevant research papers, summarize them, and gain new insights into the given domain.
We have applied POD to the provided images. We have performed tasks such as image generation, execution, and analysis of POD by plotting energy distribution among modes.
Information about how noise is affecting modal studies ,adding diffeernt artificial noise .
Performing POD on noisy image and then applying data driven methods to remove and analysing that artificial noise .
